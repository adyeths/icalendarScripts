These are just some simple scripts I wrote to make some calendar files in
icalendar format.

    usa.py
        Generates a US Holiday calendar for a specified year containing the
        federal holidays. Can optionally include additional weekly and/or
        daily observances.

    astro.py
        Generates a calendar file containing the Solstices, Equinoxes, and
        moon phases for a specified year. (Requires PyEphem.)

    elca.py
        Generates a church calendar containing the sundays and lesser festivals
        in a specified year for the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.
        (Follows the calendar year instead of the church year.)
